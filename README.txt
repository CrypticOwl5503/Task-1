I'm Mayukh Maity, a freshman majoring in Mechanical
Engineering, born and brought up in West Bengal. I love
swimming, debating and learning new things. Hope to have
a lot of fun during the Coding Week!

I want to contribute to open source because it promotes 
collaboration. I also love the open source culture as I 
believe it leads to development for everyone. Also 
doesn't hurt that it helps a bit for the selection
process :p.
